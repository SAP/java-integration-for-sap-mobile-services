# Getting Started

## Integrate the library

Builds of the library are provided as a Maven module in Maven Central. You can use them the following way:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>//ENTER GROUP ID//</groupId>
    <artifactId>//ENTER ARTIFACT ID//</artifactId>
    <version>//ENTER LATEST BUILD VERSION//</version>
</dependency>
```

## Connect via SAP Mobile Services settings file

To connect to SAP Mobile Services you need to provide a settings file to the client library.
The settings file contains the service endpoints and service keys for each mobile application.
See [SAP Mobile Services Documentation: Service Keys](https://help.sap.com/doc/f53c64b93e5140918d676b927a3cd65b/Cloud/en-US/docs-en/guides/features/security/admin/service-keys.html) how to manage service keys.

Example of a settings file:

```JSON
{
  "server": "https://any.mobile.application.url.com",
  "platform": "CF",
  "applicationId": "applicationId",
  "services": [
    {
      "name": "push",
      "serviceKeys": [
        {
          "alias": "myAlias",
          "url": "https://service.key.url.com/2787d5ea-17cb-4c71-85ca-a9600d4b97c9",
          "apiKey": "apiKey"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Properties of Settings File

| Property Name | Description | Example Value |
| --:| ----- | ----- |
| `server` | This is the mobile app URL, see SAP Mobile Services Cockpit > Mobile Applications > Native/MDK > Your Application > APIs | `https://any.mobile.application.url.com` |
| `platform` | Which platform runs the mobile services. As of now, only Cloud Foundry is supported | `CF`|
| `applicationId` | The Mobile Application Id, see  SAP Mobile Services Cockpit > Mobile Applications > Native/MDK > Your Application > Info | `applicationId` |
| `services` | List of service specific configurations |  see next paragraph ]

### Service Setting

Each service setting is represented as an entry in the services list and identified by the name.

| Property Name | Description | Example Value |
| --:| ----- | ----- |
| `name`| This specifies the service | `push` |
| `serviceKeys` | You can configure a list of service keys, but the first one is used always. | |

#### Service Keys

The service key is managed in the SAP Mobile Services Cockpit and assigned to roles.
The roles controls access to the service API.

| Property Name | Description | Example Value |
| --:| ----- | ----- |
| `alias` | The service key alias name | `myAlias`|
| `url` | The service key URL pointing to the service instance | `https://service.key.url.com/2787d5ea-17cb-4c71-85ca-a9600d4b97c9`|
| `apiKey`| The service key API key. This key is generated by Mobile Services | `apiKey`|

Use Cloud Foundry Bindings for X509 service keys.

## Connect via Cloud Foundry Binding

If your application runs on a Cloud Foundry runtime in SAP BTP, it's easy to bind it to an SAP Mobile Services Cloud Foundry service instance.
To bind the service instance, you can use the `cf bind-service` command.
See [Cloud Foundry CLI Reference Guide: bind-service](https://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/v6/bind-service.html) how to manage service bindings.

Once your application is bound to the service instance, you can retrieve it in your application:

```java
MobileServicesBinding mobileServicesBinding = MobileServicesBinding.fromVCAPVariables()
    .orElseThrow(() -> new IllegalStateException("No mobile-services binding found"));
```

Also see [Cloud Foundry Binding Sample](https://github.com/SAP/java-integration-for-sap-mobile-services/tree/main/samples/cloud-foundry-binding-sample) for a sample application that uses a service binding.

### Using X509 Binding

SAP Mobile Services also provide X509 service keys [SAP Mobile Services Documentation: Service Keys](https://help.sap.com/doc/f53c64b93e5140918d676b927a3cd65b/Cloud/en-US/docs-en/guides/features/security/admin/service-keys.html)
You can use these in bindings too.
Simply copy the uaa values from the X509 service keys details into your binding configuration file.
